# Fronius-Solar-Inverter

This driver was ported from Samsung Smartthings and originally created by a developer called Tim Flinders so all respect to him. This code has been cleaned up to support Hubitat. In addition, it has had features such as errorCode monitoring, refresh interval and changed energy to support kWh added.

How to use this driver:

Inverter Number: 1 (assuming you have a single inverter)

Port: 80
